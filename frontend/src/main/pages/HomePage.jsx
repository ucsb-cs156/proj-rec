          RecManager is a platform that helps manage recommendation requests
          between students and professors. Students can submit requests for
          recommendations, and professors can review, accept, or decline these
          requests. The system tracks request status, deadlines, and provides
          statistics on recommendation activities.

            requests, and view recommendation statistics.
